## Introduction

The Library Management System (LMS) is a Python-based console application that simplifies the management of a library's catalog and user interactions. This LMS provides basic functionality for adding books, listing books, checking out books, and adding users. While this is a simplified version, it can serve as a foundation for more advanced library management systems.
